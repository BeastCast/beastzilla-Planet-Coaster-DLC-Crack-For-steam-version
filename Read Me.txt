INSTALLATION:

- Find your game root folder: To find game root folder, find where you installed your cracked version of Planet Coaster. If you own the game but have no dlc's, go to your library, right click Planet Coaster, hit Manage and Browse Local Game files; or hit Properties, Local Files, and click browse. Now you are in Planet Coaster's root folder.

-Find "steam_api64" dll file (In game root folder) and rename to "steam_api64_o" (DO NOT PUT IN QUOTATION MARKS) Depending on your system, it might look like "steam_api64.dll" Make sure it looks like "steam_api64_o.dll" based on your system.

-Open the "PUT THESE IN GAME ROOT FOLDER" folder and paste those in your game root folder. 

-(Do this if you are having issues) DELETE the original planet coaster .EXE shortcut made by steam and try running the game from the PlanetCoaster application located in the game folder.

-DONE
